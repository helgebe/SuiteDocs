=== Release Notes

In order to facilitate European GDPR compliance, SuiteCRM 7.10 introduces two Opt-In settings,
Opt-In and Confirmed-Opt-In.

2. Confirmed Opt In further requires users to confirm their opt-in status by clicking a link sent to them 
via email. This email can be configured to send automa cally (e.g. on submission of a Web-To-Person form) or manually, 
and the template used to send this email can be customised.

*You can read more about this new feature link:/user/modules/confirmed-opt-in-settings/[here].*

===== Additional Features

* *Check PHP Version* - Minimum and Recommended PHP Versions upon installation and upgrade
* *Reply To, Reply All, Forward To and Delete* - https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/3616[#3616 ] +
This functionality is essentially how you communicate back to your recipient.  This functionality can be done via the Detail View of the Email by the Action Buttons.

{{% notice note %}}
You can only delete a non Imported Email via the List View and an Imported Email via Detail View.
{{% /notice %}}

* *Add Signatures via User Mail Accounts* - https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/3639[#3639] +
This functionality is different than in the previous email client.  A default signature can be set via the User Email Settings (within Profile) or by per Personal Account.  There is an additional dropdown when setting/editing a Personal Email Account to select an existing Signature to use.  So when you are Composing an Email you can switch between the Mail Account (the From) and the Signature will update accordingly.

* *Import Emails - set the Assign To & Relate To via Emails List and Edit View* - https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/3639[#3639] +
Again, this functionality is visually different from the previous email client but using the standard user interface as other modules.  Within the ListView you can select your target emails and Import via the Bulk Actions button.  This will open up a pop up and ask to select the appropriate values.

{{% notice note %}}
When an Email has been Imported you are able to alter these fields via the standard Edit View of the Record or using the Subpanels on the DetailView.  Subpanels are only visible when an Email has been Imported.
{{% /notice %}}

* *Flag Emails - Unread, Read, Priority* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/3636[#3636 ] & https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/3638[#3638 ] +
This functionality is again been redesigned to match the similar interface across the application. The User can select their Emails via the List View and flag them appropriately using the Bulks Action menu.

{{% notice note %}}
We currently at the time do not Delete Emails from the imap server.
{{% /notice %}}

* *Quick Create via Emails* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/3630[#3630 ] +
This functionality we felt required again to replicate what we have already in the application – the use of the quick create subpanels.  As the subpanels already provide this functionality the user will only be able to create new Records via Emails if the Email itself has been imported thus providing access to the subpanels.

code* (tar.gz)]

=== Release Notes

*Upgraded Sugar to 6.5.17*

SugarCRM have not released an official list of fixes, but thanks to Matthew Poer we have been able to list some fixes between SugarCRM 6.5.16 and 6.5.17:

* When sending an email, the Asynchronous request is sent via POST instead of GET.
* Module loader's security scanner now blocks simplexml_load_file and simplexml_load_string.
* The RSS dashlet replaces a function that once used simplexml_load_file with a new set of commands that replicate the functionality, but more (I presume) more securely.
* Quick Search can no longer be configured to search against users.user_hash (the user passwords).
* Minor bugfix in modules/Users/controller.php, a new save function to help it support a different server environment.
* Modules/Users/Save.php adjusted to further ensure that non-admins cannot adjust settings for other users.

6.5.17 introduces an important security patch.
